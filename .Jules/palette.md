## 2025-05-14 - [User Menu Modernization & Status Accessibility]
**Learning:** Modernizing legacy components like UserNav requires balancing visual parity with new design tokens while ensuring accessibility via Tooltips and proper ARIA labels. Icon-only triggers should always be wrapped in Tooltips for desktop discoverability. For live status indicators, keep text labels accessible even if the pulsing animation is decorative and hidden.
**Action:** Always wrap UserNav triggers in Tooltips and use themed tokens (bg-primary/10) instead of hardcoded colors for consistency with the v2 design system.

## 2026-06-25 - [Notifications Modernization & PageShell Adoption]
**Learning:** Adoption of centralized components like `PageShell`, `PageHeader`, `LoadingState`, and `EmptyState` dramatically reduces boilerplate and ensures visual parity with the v2 design language. For dynamic pages like Notifications, providing a manual "Refresh" action in the header alongside WebSocket support improves user confidence. Always ensure icon-only actions (like "Mark as read") have both `sr-only` text for screen readers and tooltips for sighted users.
**Action:** Use `PageShell` and `PageHeader` for all new or refactored tenant-facing pages to maintain a premium, consistent look and feel.

## 2026-06-27 - [Search Accessibility & Shortcut Discoverability]
**Learning:** Implementing the '/' keyboard shortcut for search inputs is a high-value UX pattern that must be accompanied by a visual `<kbd>` indicator for discoverability. To ensure full accessibility, icon-only action buttons in tables should be visible on focus (`focus-visible`) and wrapped in Tooltips, while inputs must have explicit `id`s and `sr-only` labels.
**Action:** Always include a `<kbd>/</kbd>` indicator in search bars and ensure icon-only buttons are accessible to keyboard users via `focus-visible` and ARIA labels.

## 2026-06-28 - [Page Modernization & Search Accessibility]
**Learning:** Modernizing secondary pages like Campaigns to use centralized components (PageShell, PageHeader) ensures a premium, cohesive UI across the platform. Integrating keyboard shortcuts (e.g., '/') for search focus is a high-impact UX win that must be paired with clear accessibility markers like <kbd> indicators and screen-reader-only labels. Icon-only actions must always be wrapped in Tooltips and made visible on focus for full keyboard navigability.
**Action:** Prioritize wrapping icon-only detail triggers in Tooltips and use 'group-focus-within' to ensure visibility during keyboard navigation.

## 2026-07-02 - [Modal-Aware Shortcuts & Visual Continuity]
**Learning:** Global keyboard shortcuts (like '/' for search) must be modal-aware and input-aware to avoid disrupting user workflows when dialogs are open or other fields are active. When migrating legacy pages to new layout shells (like `PageShell`), explicitly preserving original entrance animation durations (e.g., 500ms) maintains the intended "delight" factor without sacrificing architecture quality.
**Action:** Always check for `[role="dialog"]` or active inputs before triggering global shortcuts, and use Tailwind's `duration-XXX` classes to fine-tune entrance transitions.
